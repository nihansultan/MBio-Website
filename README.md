Designing an open-collaborative website in the field of molecular biology

## WELCOME!
Thank you for visiting the " MBiO: Designing an open-collaborative website in the field of molecular biology " project repository. This README file give you some information about the project.

### What are we doing?

We are trying to build an open educational resource on molecular biology and allow to share, connect and empower people to study in this field. We aim to evaluate the papers and make them available for everyone. Choosing a weekly topic and summarizing it that everyone can understand is the main idea.
It is very important to have a regular flow of information and to follow the literature in this field but;

* you may not be able to find free time to sit up or mental space to read and pay attention to a paper.

* you may prefer to get the main idea instead of bulk of information
 
* you may be interested in molecular biology and want to follow recently published papers

In this case, connecting community to science will make life easier and this will be the outcome of our project.

### What concrete achievements do we want to accomplish ? 

* Designing a website which provides a weekly summary of a scientific article
* Making a section in this website to share comments about the paper to improve new projects and collaborations
*	Making a section about the most recent conferences or workshops which are related with the summarized paper 
*	Making it open-collaborative so anybody can come in and commit

### Let's support openness in life science together!
This website will be an open platform for anyone who is willing to contribute. You can comment, share ideas and discuss so it will help to develop collaborations among people who are interested in scientific field. 

#### Thank you!
Thank you so much for visiting the project and we do hope that you'll join us on this our journey to allow to share, connect and empower people to study in this field !!
